# Kaggle Competitions

## Introduction

Welcome to my Kaggle competitions repository! I'm a chemical engineer with a passion for solving Kaggle competitions. Despite having limited training in data science, I aim to learn from every competition I undertake. My interests include problem-solving, watching football, Formula 1, and Nigerian movies.

Throughout my Kaggle journey, I have achieved a rank of around 2,500 in the Titanic dataset and scored 6 out of 7 in the Machine Learning Olympiad - Hausa Sentiment Analysis 2.0. 

My current challenges lie in feature engineering and data cleaning.

## Technologies and Libraries

In my competitions, I commonly use the following programming languages, tools, and libraries:

- Python
- scikit-learn
