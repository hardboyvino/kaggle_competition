## PROJECT DEFINITION
- Evaluation metric -> ROC AUC
- The objective of this competition is to predict which customers respond positively to an automobile insurance offer (binary target).
- The synthetic dataset was generated from a real dataset (both could be useful)

## THEORY
### LITERATURE REVIEW

### ASSUMPTIONS AND LIMITATIONS
- I am using a laptop with 4 CPU so running code takes a long time.
- 

### DATA DEFINITION
- X_complete -> The entire dataset
- X and val -> Train and validation dataset (Gotten by StratifiedSplit of entire dataset)
- X_resampled -> SMOTE resample of X
- X_resampled_comp -> SMOTE resample of X_complete

## RESULTS
**All results are done with a 3fold CV considering the data available is a lot**
**Except where otherwise specified**
**Numbers in bracket are the validation scores for 10% of original train data using predict**
**Numbers in square bracket are the validation scores for 10% of original train data using predict_proba**

Using synthetic train dataset only
- Baseline features (cat and binary feats OHE) -> 0.875627 (0.530917) [0.874854]

Using synthetic train and original datasets combined
- Baseline features (cat and binary feats OHE) -> 0.874902

Using synthetic train dataset only
- Baseline features (cat and binary feats OHE)
- Class weight for majority class (normalized) added to LGBMClassifier -> 0.875331
